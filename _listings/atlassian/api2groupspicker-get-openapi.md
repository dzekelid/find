  title: Jira Cloud API Find groups
  description: |-
    Returns groups with substrings matching a given query. This is mainly for use with the group picker, so the returned groups contain html to be used as picker suggestions. The groups are also wrapped in a single response object that also contains a header for use in the picker, specifically _Showing X of Y matching groups_.

    The number of groups returned is limited by the system property "jira.ajax.autocomplete.limit"

    The groups will be unique and sorted.
